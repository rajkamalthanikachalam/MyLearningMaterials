API Vs Web Servicing Testing

1) Application Programming Interface
2) All Web services are API but not all API's are web services
3) Web Service wont contain all specification but API will contains all algorithms
4) 3 styles : SOAP, REST, XML-RPC(Microservice)
5) Webservice will always need Internet but API doesn't need
6) API will also called backend testing (SOAP, RestAssured, Jmeter)
7) Using API Functional testing, reliability(during integration), performance and secure testing can be performed
8) Language Independent, datas are exchanged through Json or XML
9) Automation is faster than GIU automation
10) Protocals : JMS, RestAPI, UDDI, SOAP, HTTP 
11) Principles: Setup, Execution, Verification, Reporting, Clean up
12) API Testing Types: Validation,Functional, Load, Runtime/Error Detection,Security,Penetration, Interportability
13) API error: Missing Module error(Specific module in Schema is missing), Documentation(Request/ Response), Parameter Validation
14) API documentation : provide proper documentation about API and its functionalities
15) API Documentataion : Swagger, flatdoc, miradot, slate, Restdoc, Web service API specification
16) SOAP : XML based method to expose web services
17) Web service :RESTful sevice usually defines a URI(uniform Resources Identifier, ie., http://www.amazon.com/products/AmazonFire) a service, provides resources represntaion like JSON and HTTP methods
18) Resources in Restful services: Images, text, videos from from resources modules
